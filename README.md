# i2site

A hugo site uses github issues as input, and generated by using github actions.

`github issues` --> `issues.json` --> `hugo` --> `Github Pages`

example: https://jrdeng.github.io/i2site/

## Usage

1. clone or copy this repo as `you/you.github.io`
2. set the `master/docs` as the source of GitHub Pages in your repo
3. modify the hugo-template as you need (`config.toml`, `theme` etc.)
4. push your changes to github.
5. install [utterances](https://utteranc.es/) for comments in site.

that's almost all.

`master/docs` will be generated automatically by the Github Actions while:

- push
- issues changed

for more customization, feel free to modify the `hugo-issue2post.py` and the `.github/workflows/main.yml`.

for example, you may want to filter the issues by author, so only issues created by the author will be queried and generated to the site.
you can set `author` in action:

```
      - name: Query issues by using query-issues-action
        uses: jrdeng/query-issues-action@master
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          repo: ${{ github.repository }}
          author: ${{ github.repository_owner }}
          output_json: ./issues.json
```
